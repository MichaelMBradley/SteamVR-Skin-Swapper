# A note/WARNING about the project

This is one of the first real projects I tried in Java. It's not very good. I have since gotten better, and I hope to create a project soon that better showcases my current ability level in Java, but I always get sidetracked. I suppose I could just fix this project up as well, but that would require me taking the time to work on my abandoned projects.

This project probably doesn't work anymore, and makes use of some *really* bad practices (I think I check the registry to find the Steam installation?), I wouldn't run this if I were you.

## SteamVR-Skin-Swapper
A tool to quickly and easily replace the textures and models of Virtual Reality controllers and base stations.

Currently this tool only supports the HTC Vive components.

**This tool will not work while SteamVR is running. You must close SteamVR before using this tool.**
