# VR-Skin-Swapper
 A tool to quickly and easily replace the textures and models of Virtual Reality controllers and basestations.

 Currdently this tool only supports the HTC Vive (seeing as that is all I own), but support for other systems is coming in the near future.
 
 **This tool will not work while SteamVR is running. You must close SteamVR before using this tool.**
